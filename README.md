# CIT594-Project Report

## 1. Additional Feature
Briefly (1-2 sentences) describe the additional feature that you implemented, specifically
what computation it is performing and how it uses the three input data sets.
Also describe how you know it is working correctly. You do not have to submit test
cases but you should have something more significant to say than “we looked at the
code and it seems okay.” :-)

## 2. Use of Data Structures
Describe the use of three data structures in your program, not including the ones you
used for implementing memoization. For each one, indicate which data structure you
used, which part of the code it is used in (e.g. which feature or which class), why you
chose it, and which alternatives you considered.
Note that in some cases, there may be more than one “right” data structure to use, so
this part will be graded based on your analysis of the options and your demonstrated
understanding of their relative advantages, and not necessarily on any specific correct
answer.
